### Hi, i'm Juweyriya! 💁🏾‍♀️

I recently graduated from [School of Code](https://schoolofcode.co.uk/) as a Software Developer!
During the 16 weeks of the bootcamp  I gained a solid technical foundation and had the opportunity to work on fullstack projects.
Throughout the course i worked in an agile manner and i had multiple chances to colloborate in pairs and teams of 4. 

I'm currently on the lookout for opportunities to hone my abilities and explore new frameworks and languages!
