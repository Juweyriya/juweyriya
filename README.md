### Hi, i'm Juweyriya! 💁🏾‍♀️

I recently graduated from [School of Code](https://schoolofcode.co.uk/) as a Software Developer!

The School of Code is an intensive 16 week bootcamp, covering full stack JavaScript technologies, Agile Methodologies, and collaborative and creative problem solving, to deliver real practice. During the 16 weeks the bootcamp i learned the  fundamentals of programming, and i was educated  on the industry best practises and standards, and shown how to operate as part of a high-performing Agile tech team. I'm currently on the lookout for opportunities to hone my abilities and explore new frameworks and languages!
